How to use
Simply download the .html file and open it in whatever your default browser is. 

the offset is how long it takes for your placeholder mobs to respawn. 

some nms have 2 placeholders so i made it work for those types of mobs. 
simply track the 2 individual mobs on the 2 different timers. 

I have a quiet beep from a google audio file, but it's suddle and works well for me so suck it!
When you kill the placeholder update the new ToD and the page will hold onto the existing values you set. 

Will deny any pushes to the mob table that dont have all the fields filled out.
