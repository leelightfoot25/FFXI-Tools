How to use
I wrote these to be used as webapps I've made the CSS very generic and included one css sheet that will work with any webapp in this folder. 

Simply download the <app-name>.html and the styles.css file and open the .html in whatever your default browser is. 

timer.html is a onscreen timer that will ping your browser when the time is up. It tracks two placeholders at a time (think fuma kyahan and o-kote) or 2 different placeholders  If it dings and your Placeholder mob isnt up then the NM is.
